1. Introduction:

In modern libraries, managing diverse resources, user records, and borrowing activities presents complex challenges. The "Library Management System" project addresses these challenges by offering a user-friendly interface that empowers library staff to perform various tasks related to students, staff members, and books. The primary goals encompass streamlined access to information, accurate data management, and an enhanced user experience. By making informed decisions about data structures and algorithms, the project aims to meet these objectives while allowing for future scalability and improvements.

2. Implementation

2.1. Data Structures Selection

The project leverages the following data structures to optimize data management:


Hash Tables: Hash tables are employed for storing records of students, staff, and books. The decision is supported by their constant-time average-case operations, facilitating swift data retrieval, insertion, and removal.

Tree Structure for Book Location: The project adopts a tree structure to reflect the hierarchical organization of book locations within the library. This choice is informed by the natural categorization of books into sections across different floors and shelves. Tree structures provide logarithmic search and insertion times, making them suitable for efficient navigation and updates.

2.2. Algorithms

Various algorithms contribute to the smooth functioning of the project:

Hashing Algorithm: The project employs a well-designed hash function to minimize collisions and ensure a balanced distribution of data within the hash tables. This decision contributes to maintaining the efficiency of data access operations.

Tree Traversal Algorithms: Algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) are utilized for navigating the book location tree. These algorithms facilitate rapid and accurate retrieval of information about book placements.

3. Functions in Sub-Menus

Find Student by ID: This function enables the retrieval of a student's record by inputting their unique identification number. Leveraging the hash table's quick lookup capabilities, it ensures swift data retrieval.

Find Student by Name: Library staff can search for a student's record by entering their name. This function underscores the hash table's adaptability for different types of searches.

Edit Record by ID: This function facilitates modifications to a student's information using their unique ID. It ensures precise record updates without the need for data duplication.

Show all Students: Selecting this function displays a list of all registered students, offering an overview of the library's user base.

3.2. Staff Menu Functions

Add new Staff: This function empowers library staff to create a new staff record by entering details such as the staff member's name, ID, and contact information.

Remove a Staff: Staff can use this function to delete a staff member's record from the system using their ID. This function contributes to the accuracy of staff records.

Find Staff by ID: This function facilitates the retrieval of a staff member's record by entering their unique identification number. It showcases the hash table's efficiency in rapid data retrieval.

Find Staff by Name: Library staff can search for a staff member by entering their name. This function highlights the hash table's versatility for various search criteria.

Edit Record by ID: Similar to the student menu, this function allows modifications to staff records using their unique ID. It ensures precise updates without data duplication.

Show all Staff: Selecting this function displays a list of all registered staff members, providing an overview of the library's personnel.

3.3. Book Menu Functions

Add a new Book: This function enables library staff to create a new book record by entering details such as the book's title, author, and ISBN.

Remove a Book: Staff can use this function to delete a book's record from the system using its ISBN. This function contributes to efficient book management.

Find Book by ID: This function facilitates the retrieval of a book's record by inputting its unique International Standard Book Number (ISBN). It capitalizes on the hash table's efficiency for quick data retrieval.

Issue a Book: This function marks a book as issued to a student, updating both the student's record and the linked list of issued books. It assists in managing book loans.

Receive a Book: After a book is returned, this function updates the book's status and the linked list of issued books, indicating that the book has been received.

Show all Books: Selecting this function displays a list of all available books in the library, offering an overview of the library's collection.

4. Results and Discussion
